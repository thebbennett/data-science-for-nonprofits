# Data Science for Nonprofits
I'm passionate about leveraging data analytics for social good, so I find ways to do some data science for the nonprofits I work on! Here's a sampling of my work.

## [Monthly Donor Analysis](https://github.com/thebbennett/data-science-for-nonprofits/blob/master/monthly-donors-analysis.md)
At one nonprofit, I was tasked with finding a way to maximizing revenue with our monthly member program. When I began exploring the data in R, I realized we could almost double our revenue in a matter of months with just a few simple steps. given that so many of our monthly members were giving at a $5/month level, and we were spending more than that to deliver them their monthly member welcome packet, I concluded that we should implement higher, tiered levels of giving.


## [Historical Donor Data Cleaning](https://github.com/thebbennett/data-science-for-nonprofits/blob/master/monthly-donors-analysis.md)
At another nonprofit, I was faced with years of data mispractice. I wanted to understand our fundraising programming, but before jumping into any kind of analysis I had to clean the data. No small task considering there were years of poor data upkeep. Nevertheless, I concluded with a clean csv of donations. 

## [Historical Donor Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/thebbennett/data-science-for-nonprofits/blob/master/Historical%20Donor%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
How much are our donors giving on average? How many gifts do they give before they lapse? What is our retention rate? These statistics are core to understanding the success of a fundraising program.
